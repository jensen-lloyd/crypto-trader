Crypto trader is a project to create a neural network model from scratch in Python (ANN_trainer.py), trained on data collected by a Python script (data_scraper.py), and another program (CryptoBot.py) to make trading decisions based upon output from the Neural Network and then execute the trades via the Binance API.
