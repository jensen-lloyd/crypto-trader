plan for neural network/machine learning rig:

1. cheap pc with used parts and spend lots on a brand new gpu
2. cheap pc with used parts and spend lots on a used gpu
3. cheap pc with low end new parts and spend lots on a new gpu
4. cheap pc with low end new parts and spend lots on a used gpu
5. buy a crappy old used pc and slap a graphics card in it
6. buy a crappy old laptop and get a mPCIe adapter, power supply (which i can re-use for the gaming pc when i build it) and a decent graphics card
7. use mac mini/old laptop and get a mPCIe adapter, power supply (which i can re-use for the gaming pc when i build it) and a decent graphics card
8. wait to save up for a decent gaming pc
9. pay for cloud compute
10. use school "gaming" laptops
