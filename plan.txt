THE MASTER PLAN!    

Use data_scraper.py to get a few months worth of data to train on.

Use ANN_trainer.py to make ANN model from scratch in Python with Numpy libarary (No TF or Pytorch). 
Save model as file (not sure which file type yet. Most likely either .csv or .txt) 
Output from the network will be either:
1 neuron, output 1 meaning price will go up, output 0 meaning price will go down
2 neurons, one output being a predictor of buy, the other preducting sell, predicting the actual raw price.

Use CryptoBot.py to get current data, run it through the model, and buy or sell based on the output from the ANN.
Once everything is set up, only the CryptoBot.py script will be running, the other 2 scripts will run temporarily to a) get trainining data and b) train the model.

Plan for CryptoBot.py:

Import weights, biases etc from file
Get app required data from Binance API
Pass that data through a forward pass of the neural network function (copy the function from the ANN_trainer.py script)
Take output from network and place either a buy or sell order.

Make money! :)
